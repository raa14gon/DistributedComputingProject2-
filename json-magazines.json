        "textHistory": "The History of Quatro Rodas Magazine in Brazil and Curious Facts Quatro Rodas is one of the most traditional and influential magazines in Brazilian journalism, especially in the automotive world. Its history is closely connected to the evolution of the automobile in Brazil itself. Launched in 1960 by Editora Abril, at a time when Brazil's automotive industry was still in its early stages, Quatro Rodas was created with a clear mission: to explain cars to the average Brazilian. Back then, automobiles were transitioning from imported luxury items to symbols of progress, mobility, and modernization. The magazine played an important role in educating this new audience, teaching everything from basic mechanics to how to drive, maintain, and choose a car. From the beginning, Quatro Rodas stood out for its technical and independent journalism, something rare at the time. Its performance, fuel consumption, and durability tests became a benchmark, setting standards that are still followed today. The magazine gained a strong reputation for not sparing criticism, even when reviewing models from major manufacturers, which helped build trust among readers. During the 1970s and 1980s, as automakers expanded their operations in Brazil, Quatro Rodas closely followed the growth of the market, reviewing cars that would later become national icons. In this period, the magazine also began addressing topics such as safety, build quality, and consumer rights, going beyond pure enthusiasm for cars. In later years, the publication introduced impactful editorial projects, such as long-term tests, in which vehicles were evaluated after tens of thousands of kilometers. These tests revealed issues that only appeared with real-world use and directly influenced how manufacturers developed and improved their cars in Brazil.",
